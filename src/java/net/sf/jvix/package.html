This package contains the main jvix wrapper and object API classes.

<h1>JVIX</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

JVIX is intended to allow Java developers to use the (freely available) VIX API to 
control VMware virtual machines.

<h2>Usage</h2>

There are two methods of using JVIX; the VixWrapper interface and an object-oriented 
interface.

The VixWrapper interface simply attempts to mimic the interface of the existing C
API; there is generally a 1-to-1 relation between a VixWrapper method and a C VIX API call.
The only changes here are:

<ul>
<li> where possible, all datatypes (int, char* etc...) are represented by their native
     Java datatypes. Enumerated types are represented by integers.
<li> all handles are represented by the net.sf.jvix.VixHandle object
<li> callbacks are implemented using the net.sf.jvix.EventProc class
<li> property lists are passed into methods as Lists of Integer objects 
</ul>

The object-oriented interface adds an additional layer of abstraction over the 
native API calls; this API aims for simplicity over flexibility. Some features are 
therefore unavailable using the object-oriented interface (e.g. callbacks); almost
all methods will block until they are complete. API calls which take parameters which
are fixed or ignored are also removed from this interface. Job handle objects are
automatically released, and are generally hidden from the programmer (although 
virtual machine and snapshot handles must still be closed). 

<h2>Requirements</h2>

JVIX uses the log4j framework internally; a log4j JAR should be on the classpath; to 
enable debug logging of all JNI calls, use a log4j.properties file similar to the
following:

<pre>
  log4j.rootLogger=INFO, CONSOLE
  log4j.appender.CONSOLE=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
  log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
  log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{dd/MM/yy HH:mm:ss.SSS} %5p %c{1} - %m%n
  log4j.logger.net.sf.jvix.VixWrapper=DEBUG
</pre>

see the {@link net.sf.jvix.test.TestVix} class for an example on setting log4j properties
programatically.

<h2>Examples</h2>

See {@link net.sf.jvix.TestVix} class for examples in using the API.

<h2>Licence</h2>

JVIX is licenced under the LGPL (v3.0)

<h2>Bugs</h2>		

A small amount of memory is allocated within the C code for each event procedure 
that is passed into a VixWrapper method. This memory is not freed, and will therefore
remain unavailable to the system, creating a memory leak over time. This will be
fixed for the 1.0 release.
