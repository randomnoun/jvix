# jvix

**jvix**  is a JNI wrapper around what the vmware VIX API was 14 years ago. It certainly isn't what the VIX API is now, if indeed there is a VIX API now. 

You probably want to use libvirt or something like that instead.

## Why would anyone want to do that  ?

Think I was stopping and starting a lot of virtual machines at the time. 

This is before we started stopping and starting containers instead.


## How do I use it

Ideally, you don't.  

## Licensing
